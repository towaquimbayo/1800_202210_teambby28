## General Info
Team Burnaby 28 developed a queue management application that aims to reduce long wait times and delivers a seamless waiting experience for our users. Our application, D-Line digitalizes the lineup to change the perception of users’ wait time by providing live wait time updates, and live queue status features which eliminate the problems they face with physical lineups. Our users are provided with the freedom to do anything until they have been notified that they are next in line to enter the event.
